# Blockchain
_This README.md explains what is blockchain technology._  

### Definition
A _blockchain_ is a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network. 

### Key concepts behind blockchain 

* __Shared ledger__. A shared ledger is an _"append-only"_ distributed system of record shared across a business network. _"With a shared ledger, transactions are recorded only once, eliminating the duplication of effort that's typical of traditional business networks"_. 
* __Permissions__. Permissions ensure that transactions are secure, authenticated, and verifiable._"With the ability to constrain network participation, organizations can more easily comply with data protection regulations, such as those stipulated in the Health insurance Portability and Accountability Act(HIPAA)_" and the EU General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR). 
* __Smart contracts__. A smart contract is _"an agreement or set of rules that govern a business transaction; it's stored on the blockchain and is executed automatically as part of a transaction"_.
* __Consensus__. Through consensus, all parties agree to the network-verified transaction. Blockchains have various consensus mechanisms, including __proof of stake, multisignature, and PBFT.__ _(practical Byzantine fault tolerance)_.
